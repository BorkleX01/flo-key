  The Corresponding Clip should also be copied?
  in the dataTransfer or via storage retrieval?

  Touch modifier? Long touch?

  Dragging a clip to the keyboard will transpose it as you slide along the keyboard.
  The nature of the transposition can be configured by the keyboard.
  eg. a straight transposition up and down the standard keys
  eg. a transposition along the modes by 'panning' the keyboard (the root key stays fixed)
  what about dragging a noteOn over the keyboard? An inversion? 

  Dropping a clip on top of a noteOn defines that note as a trigger for that pattern
  Dropping a clip on top of a noteOn that belongs to it defines the start position?
  Dropping a noteOn on top of a clip prepares a start position trigget in that clip (which is adjusted by editing that clip)

  It seems like any note associated with a clip instructs that clip to play when the note plays
  A note dropped onto many clips across tracks will trigger all of them
  A note dropped onto many clips in the same track will...trigger them in order of appearance I suppose

  How a clip dropped onto many notes? 
  Each time the note plays a new spawn of that clip will play. All the configuration for that clip effects every spawn. 
  I suppose this can be used in cases where Frequency and Repeats don't help

  How about dragging keys from the keyboard onto a pattern or a sequence?
  
  Does the dial spinner belong here?

  Keyboard slides
  Guitar strum mode
  ie dragfrom key to key
